/*public static void isLeapYear(int year){â€¦}
This method checks whether a value is a leap year. If the value is divisible by 4, then it is a leap year, unless the value is also divisible by 100. However, year values that are divisible by 400 are leap years. If it is a leap year, the following should be printed to the console: "1992 is a leap year".
Example:
1996 => leap year (divisible by 4)
1900 => not a leap year (divisible by 4 but also by 100 and not by 400)
2000 => leap year (divisible by 4 and 400)
Write a loop in the Main method, which runs from 1 to 2100. Call the created method here in each case.
